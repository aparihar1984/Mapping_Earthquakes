# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Overview of the Project/Purpose
The work in the module included creating an earthquake map with two different "tile" maps and the earthquake overlay. The deliverables for the assignment involved including recent (last 7 days) earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, while also adding all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and adding the data on a third (in my case dark) map.
